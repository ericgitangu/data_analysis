Predictive Analysis Framework:

        1. External Factors to Consider:
        - Economic indicators: GDP, inflation rates, consumer price index
        - Seasonal factors: weather patterns, holidays, events
        - Market dynamics: competitor pricing, new market entrants
        - Supply chain metrics: supplier reliability, lead times

        2. Proposed Methodology:
        - Time series models (SARIMA) incorporating seasonal components
        - Machine learning models (XGBoost, Random Forests) for multi-factor analysis
        - Neural networks for complex pattern recognition
        - Regular model retraining pipeline for accuracy maintenance
