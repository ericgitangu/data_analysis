Scalability Recommendations:

        1. Data Storage:
        - Implement distributed storage using Hadoop/HDFS or cloud solutions (AWS S3)
        - Partition data by date ranges for efficient querying
        - Use columnar storage formats like Parquet for better compression
        - Use Database sharding to distribute data across multiple servers
        - Ensure Database follows ACID properties - Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation, and Durability
        - Implement database replication for high availability and fault tolerance
        - Use database indexing to optimize query performance
        - Implement database backup and recovery procedures

        2. Processing Optimization:
        - Leverage Apache Spark for distributed data processing
        - Implement data streaming for real-time analysis
        - Use caching strategies for frequently accessed data
        - Using event-driven architecture to handle data streaming
        - Implement data processing pipelines for efficient data transformation and loading
        - Implement DLQs (Dead Letter Queues) to handle failed messages
        - Implement monitoring and alerting for system performance and errors
        - Implement data quality checks and validation processes
        - Implement data versioning and auditing to track changes and ensure data integrity
        - Implement data masking and anonymization to protect sensitive information
        - Use retry and exponential backoff strategies for data processing
