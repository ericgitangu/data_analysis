>This project performs a comprehensive analysis of the Kwanza Tukule dataset, including data cleaning, exploration, advanced analytics, strategic recommendations, and an interactive dashboard. The results and insights are saved both to the **console and to files** for easy access. Also note for plots generated, you need to close the current chart (Matplotlib) to proceed with execution and watch out for the interactive dashboards (Total Value by Category) & (Sales Trends Over Time) with both open on localhost using plotly.

## ðŸ“š Features

- **Section 1: Data Cleaning and Preparation**
  - Inspects the dataset for missing values, duplicates, and inconsistent data types.
  - Creates a `Month-Year` column for temporal analysis.

- **Section 2: Exploratory Data Analysis**
  - Aggregates sales by category and business.
  - Visualizes trends over time with bar and line charts.

- **Section 3: Advanced Analysis**
  - Segments customers based on purchasing behavior.
  - Provides insights into high-, medium-, and low-value customer groups.

- **Section 4: Strategic Insights and Recommendations**
  - Outputs recommendations for product strategy, customer retention, and operational efficiency.
  - Saves recommendations to a file for reporting.

- **Section 5: Dashboard and Reporting**
  - Generates an interactive dashboard with:
    - Total Quantity and Value by Anonymized Category.
    - Top-performing products and businesses.
    - A time-series chart of sales trends.
    - A segmentation summary of customer groups.
  - Built using `plotly` for interactivity.

- **Bonus Section: Open-Ended Problem**
  - Discusses scalability and predictive analysis methodologies.
  - Saves responses to a file for documentation.

## PR Request and note:

> Initiate a PR reequest to Evans Biwott on this private repo. Along with the console output as seen in the screenshot there are also output files in the strategic_insights_recommendations/ folder and the bonus_questions/ folder along with the browser rendering via plotly which address the assessment questions and also some are extra work particularly the **/strategic_insights_recommendations/insights_overview.txt** file. Thanks for taking your time to go througn my work!
